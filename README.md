**THIS IS THE ULTIMATE COOKIE**

### Ingredients:
- [] A **Pizza base**
- [] Enough **Pizza sauce** (red sauce or pesto)
- [] A lot of **Cheese**
- [] A couple **Olives**
- [] A even more couple of **Onions**
- [] Other assorted ingredients that you want on your cookie.

### Steps:
1. Put the sauce on the pizza base. Make sure it is reasonably spread out.
2. Add the cheese. Spread this out and make sure it covers all of the sauce. Covering the sauce will help in the oven.
3. Add all of the other ingredients like the olives and onions. Spread these out evenly on your pizza base. 
4. Bake in an oven set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit or 190.556 degrees Celsius. 
5. After 10 minutes take your cookies out and depending on your pizza base cut it evenly into parts.
6. Enjoy your cookies!
